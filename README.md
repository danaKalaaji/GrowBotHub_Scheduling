## üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview ‚Äì GrowBotHub Scheduling
This repository contains the work done as part of a semester project within **GrowBotHub**, an EPFL student association designing autonomous vertical farms for space exploration, particularly for future missions on the Moon. Our system is part of **IGLUNA: A Habitat in Ice**, where we will deploy and test a working prototype during the 2021 Field Campaign.

### üéØ Focus of This Work: Scheduling

Our team was responsible for developing and optimizing the **scheduling algorithm** that dictates the movement of plants across a vertical aeroponic farm to:
- Maximize plant production over a given period.
- Ensure plants receive the right nutrients at the right time.
- Respect physical constraints like module capacity and plant size.
- Adapt to delays via **real-time rescheduling**.

We built on the work of the previous semester team, which used a **multi-commodity flow model** with the PuLP solver. We improved their algorithm, implemented new features requested by GrowBotHub, and handled dynamic updates during execution.

### ü§ù Part of a Larger System

Our scheduling system integrates with other subsystems developed in parallel by interdisciplinary teams:
- **Structure** ‚Äì Designing the physical layout and movement mechanisms.
- **Aeroponics** ‚Äì Managing water and nutrient delivery.
- **Robotics** ‚Äì Programming the robotic arm and vision system.
- **Networking** ‚Äì Facilitating communication between components and Earth control.
- **Chemical Engineering** ‚Äì Designing nutrient solutions and handling waste.
